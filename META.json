  "description": "MySQL is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). Originally developed by Michael \"Monty\" Widenius and now owned by Oracle Corporation, MySQL is the world's second-most widely used relational database management system. It serves as a FOSS alternative to commercial databases like Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, or IBM Db2, offering enterprise-grade reliability, performance, and scalability without licensing costs, with features like ACID compliance, transactions, replication, and clustering.",
